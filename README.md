# WordNET

The WordNET is a lexicon for the English Language. The program is grouping words into sets of synonyms known as synsets, and it also describes the semantic relationships between those synsets. Those relationships are categorized to hyponums, a more specific set of synonyms, and to hypernyms, a more general set of synonyms. 

## Examples of a synset and its hypernym
* A set of synonyms or *synset*: {AND circuit, AND gate}
* A hypernym set of the above is: {gate, logic gate}  


This project was implemented throughout the course "Intermediate Computing with Data Structures" (cs210). The goal was to learn proper design principles, dynamic data structures, and recursion. For this particular project, I undestood the concept of undirected and directed graphs.
